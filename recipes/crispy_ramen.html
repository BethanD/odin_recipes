<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Okay, it might at some point seem that this is a weird meal, but this shit is crazy good. Crispy fried sesame ramen will change your life.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You could probably use other ramen brands or flavours, but my go-to is Damae Sesame Ramen.</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil (extra)</li>
        <li>A little tin of sweet corn</li>
        <li>An egg, boiled/fried/poached (optional)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add two cm of water to a large frying pan. When it's boiling add your dry ramen.</li>
        <li>Once the ramen is nice and soggy and it has drunk up the water (add a bit more if necessary), add 2-3 tablespoons of sesame oil (the ramen pack contains a sachet of sesame oil but this is not enough), and add the spice packet.</li>
        <li>Mix well and mix regularly at a high tempreature. Add the corn.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil/poach/fry your egg. If you want you could wait until the ramen is done and fry the egg in the empty pan after.</li>
        <li>Once the ramen is golden and crispy it is done!</li>
    </ol>
