<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Okay, it might at some point seem that this is a bit of a weird meal, but if you're low on time and want a bit of comfort food in your belly, it is crazy good.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You could potentially use any instant ramen brand and/or flavours, but my go-to is Damae Sesame Ramen</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil (extra)</li>
        <li>A little tin of sweet corn</li>
        <li>An egg, boiled/fried/poached (optional)</li>
        <li>Any other additional veggies that you want to throw in there are of course welcome</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add around two cm of water to a large frying pan. When it's boiling add your dry ramen.</li>
        <li>Once the ramen is nice and soggy and it has drunk up the water (add a bit more if necessary), add 2-3 tablespoons of sesame oil (the ramen pack contains a sachet of sesame oil but this is not enough), and add the spice packet.</li>
        <li>Mix well and mix often at a high tempreature. Add the corn and continue to mix.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil/poach/fry your egg and prepare any extras you want to add. If you want you could wait until the ramen is done and fry the egg in the empty pan after.</li>
        <li>Once the ramen is golden and crispy it is done. Add your egg and optional extras and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
